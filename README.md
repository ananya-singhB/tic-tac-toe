This is a simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with Next.js App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project demonstrates core React principles such as state management, conditional rendering, and component reactivity. Players take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid until one wins or the game ends in a draw. It features a responsive UI, reset functionality, and winner detection logic â€” making it a perfect starter project for learning Next.js and modern frontend development.
